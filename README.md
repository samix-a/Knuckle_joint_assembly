# Knuckle Joint Assembly

This repository contains a 3D CAD assembly model of a knuckle joint, developed using SolidWorks. The model represents a standard mechanical component used to connect two rods under tensile load while allowing a limited degree of angular movement.

## File Information

- **File name**: `knuckle joint.SLDASM`
- **Software**: SolidWorks 2022 or later
- **File type**: Assembly (.SLDASM)
- **Required files**: All part files used in the assembly (e.g., fork, eye, pin, collar) should be in the same folder

## Features

- Fully constrained SolidWorks assembly model of a knuckle joint
- Accurately designed standard components based on machine design specifications
- Useful for educational and simulation purposes
- Can be used to create exploded views and 2D technical drawings

## Purpose

The assembly was created as part of a mechanical design project to demonstrate:
- 3D modeling and assembly skills using SolidWorks
- Understanding of pin-type mechanical joints
- Application of standard fits and tolerances

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the `knuckle joint.SLDASM` file in **SolidWorks 2022 or later**
2. Make sure all associated `.SLDPRT` files (part models) are located in the same directory
3. Use the model for:
   - Motion analysis
   - Technical drawing creation
   - Assembly simulation
   - Educational presentations or demonstrations
